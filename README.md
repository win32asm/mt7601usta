*MT7601U Linux driver*
--
***Note: Kernel 4.2 has been released which contains a driver for mt7601u, this repository is now deprecated.***

*This repo is forked from [imZack/mt7601] (https://github.com/imZack/mt7601) and I have added binary packages for this version.*

[imZack](http://github.com/imZack/) added some features for this driver:

- Add supports for [Xiaomi MiniWifi](http://www.mi.com/miniwifi/) `USB_DEVICE(0x2717,0x4106)`
- Add supports for [Synology DS713+](http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.php/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have) (x86 cedarview)

Many cheap USB wifi dongles use the MediaTek MT7601U chip.

Unfortunately, there is no driver in Linux kernel source tree which can work with this chip, yet. This repository is based on the original driver released by MediaTek which was rejected from Linux kernel because of the poor code quality. The repository includes various stability and performance improvements for kernels >= 3.x and has been tested with the following kernels:

- 3.15.10-200.fc20.x86_64
- 3.16.1-301.fc21.x86_64
- 3.16.1-301.fc21.i686
- 3.17.0-0.rc2.git3.1.fc22.i686
- 3.17.0-0.rc2.git3.1.fc22.x86_64
- 3.12.26-1.20140808git4ab8abb.rpfr20.armv6hl.bcm2708

### Usage for Synology DS713+

First get Synology [toolchain](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dsgpl/files/DSM%205.1%20Tool%20Chains/) and [kernel source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dsgpl/files/Synology%20NAS%20GPL%20Source/5004branch/)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/art567/mt7601usta.git
$ cd mt7601/src
$ export LINUX_SRC=/home/syno/source/linux-3.x
$ export CROSS_COMPILE=/home/syno/toolchains/5.1/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-
$ make
```

Now you have to copy `os/linux/mt7601Usta.ko` and `RT2870STA.dat` to your target machine.

On target:
```sh
$ mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
$ cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
$ insmod mt7601Usta.ko
```

The interface will be **ra0**.

> Currently the DSM WebGUI will not be able to use the wifi dongle so far, but it works with command line.

### Unofficial mt7601u driver

For kernels 3.19 and later a new mac80211 driver was written from scratch by the community.  It was done because there is very little chance that this vendor driver will ever become part of official Linux kernel. If you have Linux kernel version between 3.19 and 4.2 you can download the new driver from https://github.com/kuba-moo/mt7601u. If you have Linux 4.2 or later the new driver is already part of the kernel (it's called mt7601u). Note that from Linux 4.2 on you will have to blacklist the mt7601u driver to continue using code from this repository.

### Usage

First install kernel-devel for your Linux distro

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/art567/mt7601usta.git
$ cd mt7601/src
$ make
$ mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
$ cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
$ insmod os/linux/mt7601Usta.ko
```

If the module has loaded OK, you should see `mt7601Usta` listed in the output of `lsmod` and a new network interface `ra0` should be present in the output of `ip link`.

If all goes well, you can permanently install the driver with `make install`.

#### Gentoo

In order to successfully compile this driver for Gentoo, you must compile your kernel with the appropriate wireless extensions included. One way to do that is by enabling *Cisco/Aironet 34X/35X/4500/4800 PCMCIA cards* wireless module. If you see errors when compiling the driver, check to see if you have the necessary wireless extensions by running `zgrep -i wext /proc/config.gz`. The output should look something like:

```
CONFIG_WEXT_CORE=y
CONFIG_WEXT_PROC=y
CONFIG_WEXT_SPY=y
CONFIG_WEXT_PRIV=y
CONFIG_CFG80211_WEXT=y
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu

There is a PPA repo available containing a DKMS-capable package based on this repo:

### History

On 26 Aug, 2014 user **@poma** posted to the [linux-wireless](http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/MailingLists) mailing list discussing the poor state of driver support for this chipset. Thread can be seen here:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/msg126115.html

An inital patch was released on 28 Aug, 2014 with the following comment:
```
A patch[1] is composed partly from the RT3573 source code patched by ashaffer, from Andreas work, some of the ideas are from the beagleboard community, and some of my. :)
Debug(trace) is turned off.

Device now works more or less OK but slow, max. 10 Mbit, although connectable is only within the "N" & "N/G" modes.
What is important is the system no longer crashes, and disconnection are rare.
Generally better than before.

```

A second patch was released on 31 Aug, 2014 with the following comment:

```
A new patch[1] mainly based on patches at 
https://github.com/ashaffer/rt3573sta
and several network throughput tests via the Iperf.
```
